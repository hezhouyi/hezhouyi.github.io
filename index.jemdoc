== About me
I am an M.Phil student at the Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology supervised by Prof. [https://chem.ust.hk/node/96 Haibin Su]. Currently, I am working on Theoretical Biophysics and Computational Biology. 

I proudly received my B.Sc. degree in Chemical Physics from [https://en.ustc.edu.cn/ University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)], which is considered one of the best Universities in the fields of frontier research and undergraduate education in China. Publication related to my undergraduate thesis can be seen in /[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2516-1075/ab5e5a/pdf Unit Cell Consistency of Maximally Localized Wannier Functions]/.

During my M.Phil study, my research especially focuses on the application of statistical mechanics and evolutionary theory in complex biological systems such as CRISPR Cas9 systems and nucleotide\/protein sequence space. Preprint of my recent work can be seen in [https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.29.474427 Dynamic Expedition of Leading Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins ].

I am interested in interdisciplinary research and currently looking for a Ph.D. position!
